Potentially add keybind? (make it "\"?)

Now for making it multiplayer...
For multiplayer compatability, just make a table containing all the data needed, adjust GetPlayerData to use that instead, 
then compress that table using json and send it to the clients. They should be able to also use GetPlayerData since it was 
modified...
