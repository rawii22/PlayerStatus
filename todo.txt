Starting from the middle, add half of the screen width moving to the right edge.
To move it back on the screen, add half of the widget width to the left. (margin?)

For multiplayer compatability, just make a table containing all the data needed, adjust GetPlayerData to use that instead,
then compress that table using json and send it to the clients. They should be able to also use GetPlayerData since it was
modified...
